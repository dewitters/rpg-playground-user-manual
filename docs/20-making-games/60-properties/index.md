The `hero` cannot be renamed yet, which is something we're still [working on](https://trello.com/c/2dPV7Ojf). It also can't be deleted.

### Ambient/music radio

Levels can play both music and ambient sounds in the background. This will start playing once you enter this level. Afterwards you can still change what is playing with actions.

- **File**: select what to play in the background of the level:
    - **\<previous song\>**: Keep playing the song that's already playing from a previous level.
    - **\<silence\>**: Don't play anything.
    - **...**: Various songs to select.
- Play **volume** can be set from **0** (mute) to **100** (loudest).
