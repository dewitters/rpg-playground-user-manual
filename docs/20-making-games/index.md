# Making games

## Your first game

RPG Playground is ideal for making your first game. It's **simple,** **intuitive** and **easy**. And most of all, it makes game development **fun**!


## The edit panel

When your game is running, on the top-left there is an `Edit game` button.

When clicking it, the *edit panel* will open on the left side of the screen. The game will be paused at that point

:::tip[Fun fact]

When I was first developing RPG Playground, the editor would keep the game running. This resembles how Minecraft works. But it was too cumbersome to click on moving monsters etc., so I implemented a pause, which works much better.
