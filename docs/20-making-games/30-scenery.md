# Scenery

What is a game without a beautiful world to explore?

In the *scenery tab* you can add and remove scenery such as trees, buildings, tables, etc. to your level. This is the first step in creating a beautiful world for your game.

Remark that scenery is not really responsive to interactions, or is very limited.

:::info

Scenery is not only visual, but can block the movement of actors. This is called collisions.

## Toolbar

The toolbar offers specific tools to modify the scenery in your level. Let's take a look at all of them.


### ![](img/scenery_paint_tool.png) Paint object


### ![](img/scenery_erase_tool.png) Erase object


### ![](img/scenery_erase_tile_tool.png) Erase tile


### ![](img/scenery_rect_tool.png) Fill rectangle

#### Single tile

#### 3 tiles

#### 3x3 tiles


### ![](img/scenery_fill_tool.png) Fill area


### ![](img/scenery_move_tool.png) Move object

Objects can be moved around by selecting the move tool, and clicking on the object you want to move. The object will be selected, and you can drag it around. When you are happy with the new position, release to place it.


### ![](img/scenery_picker_tool.png) Tile picker

Don't know in which tileset a certain tile is? Select the tile picker tool, and click on the tile you want to know more about. The tileset dropdown will automatically select the correct tileset, and the tile or object will be selected. This tool will save you a lot of searching time!


## Tileset dropdown

## Auto layering

When you place objects, they will automatically be placed in front or behind each other. This seems logical, but in most game development tools this is not the case. 


:::tip

Decorate your levels so the feel lively, even when you didn't add all the actors yet.

Think about what the people and creatures would need. A smithy probably needs some wood to burn. A farm needs hay for the animals. A wizard's tower needs a lot of books, and a lot of magical ingredients. Maybe the wizard is very messy and leaves things everywhere. The farmer might have a chair outside, to sit and watch the sunset.

*TODO: Insert 2 pictures, left one is empty, right one is decorated*
