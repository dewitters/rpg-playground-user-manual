## What is different about RPG Playground?

In RPG Playground you build your game while you play it. This means you get instant feedback of your changes. Simply open the project panel on the left, and make your changes straight away. There is no real separation between editor and game anymore, you design your game while playing it.

The normal workflow of game maker tools is to start up the editor, edit tilemaps, behaviours, etc, and then generate the game. Once the game is generated, you can test it. If you want to change something, you exit the game and go back to the editor. This kind of workflow can be cumbersome and time consuming.

There are several advantages using our approach:

- You see the impact of your changes immediately in the game
- It‚Äôs more fun to work inside your game than inside a boring editor
- No need to search for the resource to adapt, you can just click on it and start editing
- Continue playing where you left off
- No need to compile/build your game before you play it
