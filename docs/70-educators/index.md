# For Educators

RPG Playground is ideal for use in the classroom. 

It has a wide variety of applications that go far beyond STEM subjects:

- **History**: Let students create games set in a historical period.
- **Literature & Interactive Storytelling**: Recreate a scene from a book, or let students create their own stories.
- **Game Design**: Focus on the game mechanics instead of the programming.
- **Learn to code**: Underlying Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts can be taught using our actions system.


Our core features make it particularly suitable for use in an educational setting:

- **Ideal for beginners**: It is simple, intuitive and easy to use, so students can jump right in.
- **No download required**: Runs in the browser, so it can be used on any device with an internet connection, including Chromebooks.
- **No coding required**: A visual game maker, so students can create games without having to write any code.
- **Privacy**: We don't collect any personal information and we comply with all privacy regulations.



There are a few ways in which RPG Playground can be used in the classroom:

1. Students create their own games, either individually, in pairs or in groups.
2. Teachers create educational games for students to play.
3. Studends create educational game in groups, covering different topics. Groups play each other's games and learn that topic.

RPG Playground could also be offered as an optional choice for group projects. Students are actually introducing RPG Playground to their teachers in such settings.
