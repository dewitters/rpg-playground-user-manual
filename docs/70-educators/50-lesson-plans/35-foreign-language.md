# Lesson Plan: Foreign language

In German: https://openilias.phzh.ch/ilias.php?ref_id=192&obj_id=1&cmd=layout&cmdClass=illmpresentationgui&cmdNode=gc&baseClass=ilLMPresentationGUI

## Introduction

This learning object deals with dialogue-based computer games. It shows how a lesson sequence can be developed so that students can create a small, dialogue-based computer game themselves. The software offers a modular system from which a small world, characters and simple game mechanics can be put together to form a finished game. Texts such as simple dialogues, a short story and some tasks are written in French and programmed in.
 
The aim is to combine and promote media literacy and French in a motivating way. At the same time, differentiation opportunities are created in the areas of: language skills in French (written and dialogic skills), media and IT skills and social skills. The students use the free, web-based (and therefore uncomplicated) software RPGPlayground.com . 


## Questions

This learning object should address the following questions:
- Which subject areas and competences can be promoted and how effectively through the creation of a computer game (French language skills, IT skills and social skills)?
- How can a computer game be used to link the fields of media and information technology (MI) and French in a motivating way?
- To what extent does the computer game support a competence-oriented application of concepts from MI and foreign language teaching?
- What differentiation possibilities does the design of dialogues in a computer game offer in language acquisition?
- What supporting tools (both in MI and in French lessons) do the students need so that they can complete the task as autonomously as possible?

## Competencies of foreign language teaching

Some possible connections with the Curriculum 21 (selection):

The students ...
- can create lists and label pictures using known words. (FS2F.4.A.1.1a)
- can write information about themselves or familiar people and situations in simple terms. (FS2F.4.A.1.2b)
- can use writing strategies if they are partially supported in doing so and discuss their benefits. (4.B.1b)
- can understand simple short texts with the help of illustrations. (2.A.1.2b)
- can understand simple short messages. (2.A.1.2b)
- can immerse themselves in simple, short texts illustrated with pictures. (2.A.2b)


## Competencies in media education and computer science

Some possible connections with the Curriculum 21 (selection):

The students ...
- can use media to create and present their work. (MI.1.3.c)
- can use media to present and/or publish their ideas and knowledge to an audience. (MI.1.3.f)
- can read and manually execute simple processes with loops, conditional statements and parameters.
- understand that a computer can only execute predefined instructions and that a program is a sequence of such instructions.
- can write and test programs with loops, conditional statements and parameters.

## Student Example Games 

The three examples below were created by students in a 6th grade primary school class over a period of 10 lessons in groups of two.

## Interview

TODO

## Didactic feasibility

The challenge of dialogue-based computer games in foreign language teaching is to break down the individual steps involved in creating a computer game and developing a small French dialogue to such an extent that the students can tackle them in small, autonomous groups and are challenged but not overwhelmed at the same time. This requires good planning preparation on the part of the teachers and sufficient support options (scaffolding, chunks, models, etc.) for the students.

---

### Scaffolding

In the context of education and psychology, scaffolding  refers to supporting the learning process by providing an initial, complete basis for orientation in the form of instructions, food for thought and other assistance. As soon as the learner is able to work on a specific subtask independently, this "scaffolding" is gradually removed. Scaffolding is assigned to the constructivist learning theories.

Scaffolding tools and resources:
- Provide feedback on the approach and results
- Provide tips and suggestions
- Pre-structured notes
- Didactic materials, aids, models, ...
- Simplify the task
- Take on parts that overwhelm students (sentence beginnings, “chunks”, gap-filling texts, clarifying terms)
- Instruct: Explain and justify what needs to be done
- Provide detailed, specialist information and clarification aids
- Be a model: show, “think out loud”
- Ask questions that are cognitively and linguistically activating

### Chunks

Chunks are unanalyzed combinations that consist of several words but are experienced and learned as a single unit, as if they were a single word. Westhoff, Gerald (2007): Grammatic Rules and the German-speaking Community. Babylonia 1/08, 15 .

## Example lesson planning

### Process of lesson planning

This chapter shows a possible lesson plan for the implementation of a dialogue-based computer game in French lessons. The lesson is based on the following three steps:

#### 1. First familiarization with the software

- Get to know and try out the RPGPlayground program
- Design a level (game world) with the program

#### 2. In groups, draw up a game plan on paper

- Design characters, possibly a small background story
- Sketch 2-3 quests (short stories with tasks) and present them in a structured manner (with a flow chart)
- Design and formulate corresponding dialogues in French using supporting language elements (support langagier, chunks)

#### 3. Transfer am Computer / Tablet

- Then embed these dialogues, short descriptions or stories or tasks in the program and implement them (alone or in groups)
- The students play the game of another group
- (Optional: Students give feedback to the other group; > implement feedback)
- (Optional: Now that the process is better known, play through the process again in the same or a new group and create a new game/level/quest)


### Scope of teaching sequences

To ensure that students have enough time to familiarize themselves with the software, create their own little story or task, and embellish it with self-created French dialogues, 5 to 10 lessons are planned for implementation in class. This allows for interdisciplinary teaching in which media, IT and French are interlinked. Within the individual lessons, students can work on the computer/tablet as well as on the French dialogues of their characters. 

### Example of an approximate lesson plan (5-10 lessons)

TODO: In table

#### 1st lesson
Introduction to the game by the teacher's example, exploration of the program by the students

#### Lessons 2 and 3
Different activities to explore the program (e.g. how to create a character, how to introduce dialogue)

#### Lessons 4, 5 and 6
Give the task “objective: create your own game”, taking into account the following aspects: What situation, what environment, what characters
Establish the link with the Dis donc! unit
Create the dialogues: introduce the linguistic supports, chunks, model sentences
First version of the dialogues on paper, correction by the teacher, revision by the students

#### Lessons 7 and 8
Making the game on the computer

#### Lessons 9 and 10
Introducing games to the class and playing other people's games
