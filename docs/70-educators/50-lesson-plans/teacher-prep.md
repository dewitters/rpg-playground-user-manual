## Student Accounts

It is possible to use the free version of RPG Playground for your students. However, it is recommended to subscribe to the teacher dashboard, which provides you with a lot of benefits:

- Both teacher and students get access to all the premium features.
- Create and manage students accounts and classes easily.
- Students log in with an access code, so they don't need an email address.
- Quick overview of all student projects.


### Teacher dashboard

Having access to the teacher dashboard is the fastest and easiest way to set up student accounts, and manage your classroom.




### Free version

Using the free version in your classroom is possible, but more cumbersome. 

- Students will have to create and activate their own accounts using their email address. 
- You won't get a quick overview of your student projects.
- Students and teacher don't get access to premium features.


It's best to try and let students set up their accounts before the lesson starts. If that is not possible, dedicate some time at the start of the lesson to let students create their accounts.

1. Have students go to https://rpgplayground.com/register and create an account. Don't use any real names for usernames!
2. Students will receive an email to activate their account. Have them click the link.
3. Possible problems with not receiving the activation email:
    - Check the spam folder.
    - They might have misspelled their email address.
    - Contact us at [info@rpgplayground.com](mailto:info@rpgplayground.com?subject=Please activate student account) if you need help activating an account.

Students need to share their project with you. They will need to save their game with *Game Visibility* set to:

- **Public**: Everyone can see the game, but it won't be listed in the public RPG Playground games.
- **Release**: The game will be listed in the public RPG Playground games. Great choice for students who want to share their game with the world.
- **Password protected**: Only people with the password can see the game. This is a good choice to only share the game with teacher or classmates.


## Suggested class structure


#### Donâ€™t have a computer or headphones for each student?

Pair or group students. Assign one student as the "driver" who controls the computer and one as the "instructor" who describes what to do. Switch roles every five minutes.

Whole class. Project the lesson and videos on a screen where all students can see. After watching the Introduction video, have the class suggest how you might build the project.

Station rotation. If you have a computer station in your classroom, allow students to rotate to the computers to complete the lesson.
