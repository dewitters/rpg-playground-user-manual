# Lesson Plan: Game design


- Gating: only allow the player to progress if they have completed a task or answered a question correctly.
- Feedback from players

Level 9: Stories and Games

Level 10: Nonlinear Storytelling


Level Design: Students can learn how to create engaging and well-structured levels. They can experiment with pacing, difficulty curves, and player guidance within a controlled environment.

Narrative Structure and Branching: These tools allow students to create complex storylines with branching paths. This helps in understanding how choices and consequences affect the playerâ€™s experience and the overall narrative flow.

Game Mechanics: With built-in systems for combat, inventory, and character progression, students can explore various game mechanics and understand how they interact. They can modify and balance these mechanics to see their effects on gameplay.

User Experience (UX) Design: By designing menus, dialogues, and interfaces, students can learn about UX principles and how to create intuitive and engaging user experiences.

Balancing and Pacing: Students can experiment with balancing different aspects of the game, such as enemy difficulty, resource availability, and reward systems, to ensure a smooth and engaging experience for players.

Prototyping and Iteration: The ease of use and rapid development cycle in these tools encourage students to prototype ideas quickly and iterate on them. This teaches the importance of testing and refining game elements based on feedback.

Puzzle and Challenge Design: Students can create puzzles and challenges, learning how to balance difficulty and provide satisfying solutions without frustrating the player.

Spatial Awareness and Map Design: Through designing maps and environments, students gain an understanding of spatial design, which is crucial for creating immersive and navigable game worlds.

Event and Trigger Systems: Learning to use event and trigger systems helps students understand cause-and-effect relationships within games, essential for creating interactive and dynamic game environments.

Resource Management: By incorporating resource systems (like health, currency, or items), students can learn about designing and managing game economies and ensuring that resources are appropriately balanced and rewarding.

Player Feedback and Rewards: Students can design and implement systems for providing feedback and rewards to players, helping them understand how to motivate and engage players through positive reinforcement and goal-setting.
