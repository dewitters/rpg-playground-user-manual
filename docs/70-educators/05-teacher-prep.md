# Teacher prep

Don't worry about not being an expert when you introduce RPG Playground into your classroom. The software is designed to be easy to use for students and teachers.

For your first lesson, you can figure it out together with your students. Some of them will be very quick to pick it up and can help others. So when someone gets stuck, let students help each other out.

You don't need to know everything as a teacher: "I may not know the answer, but together we can figure it out."

We provide [various resources](../#questions-and-answers) so you and your students can find answers to all your questions. 



## Materials

- Computer (can be a ChromeBook) with internet access to:
    - [rpgplayground.com](https://rpgplayground.com)
    - [YouTube.com](https://youtube.com)

## Setup and learn the basics

1. Register for a free account at https://rpgplayground.com/register.
1. Create a new game by going to [Make](https://rpgplayground.com/make/) and clicking on [New Game](https://rpgplayground.com/new-game/).
1. A popup will ask you to watch the [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/D54SjyJAxjs?si=Ru4_99jhB76vm2AH). This tutorial will teach you all the basics in 10 minutes.
1. Try to create a simple game with a few levels, characters, and dialogues, as shown in the [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/D54SjyJAxjs?si=Ru4_99jhB76vm2AH).
1. If you need specific information, look at our [documentation, tutorials and community](../#questions-and-answers).
1. If you want premium features, already subscribe your class to the [**Teacher Dashboard**](https://rpgplayground.com/teachers/) or get an [individual license](https://rpgplayground.com/upgrade/).


## Register student accounts

Although it's possible to use the free version of RPG Playground for your students, we recommended to subscribe to the [**Teacher Dashboard**](https://rpgplayground.com/teachers/), which provides you with a lot of benefits:

- Both teacher and students get access to **all premium** features.
- Create and **manage students accounts** and classes easily.
- Students log in with an **access code**, so they don't need an email address.
- You get a **quick overview** of all student projects.


### Teacher dashboard

Save yourself the pain of setting up student accounts and managing them.

A membership to the Teacher Dashboard is the fastest and easiest way to set up student accounts and manage your classroom.

Read all about it on the [Teacher Dashboard](teacher-dashboard) page.



### Free version

Using the free version in your classroom is possible, but **more cumbersome**. 

- ðŸ˜§ **Student self register**: Students use their email address to create **and activate** their own accounts. 
- ðŸ˜¢ **No project overviews**: You won't get a quick overview of your student projects.
- ðŸ˜­ **No premium features**: Students and teacher won't get access to premium features.


It's best to try and let students set up their accounts before the lesson starts. If that is not possible, dedicate some time at the start of the lesson to let students create their accounts.

1. Have students go to https://rpgplayground.com/register and create an account. Don't use any real names for usernames!
2. Students will receive an email to activate their account. Have them click the link.
3. Possible problems with not receiving the activation email:
    - Check the spam folder.
    - They might have misspelled their email address.
    - Contact us at [info@rpgplayground.com](mailto:info@rpgplayground.com?subject=Please%20activate%20student%20account) if you need help activating an account.

Students need to share their project with you. They will need to save their game with *Game Visibility* set to:

- **Public**: Everyone can see the game, but it won't be listed in the public RPG Playground games.
- **Release**: The game will be listed in the public RPG Playground games. Great choice for students who want to share their game with the world.
- **Password protected**: Only people with the password can see the game. This is a good choice to only share the game with teacher or classmates.
