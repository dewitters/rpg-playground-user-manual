## What is RPG Playground?

RPG Playground is the easiest way to make your own Action RPG. It runs in your web browser and you can try it at http://rpgplayground.com.

A great story and a lot of imagination is all you need. Programming, graphics and music is provided.

RPG Playground is constantly under development, so new features are added all the time. Take a look at [our roadmap](https://trello.com/b/5i4VvOW8) to see what is being worked on. You can vote on your favorite features to move them up in priority.

## What makes RPG Playground different?

In RPG Playground you build your game while you play it. This means you get instant feedback of your changes. Simply open the project panel on the left, and make your changes straight away. There is no real separation between editor and game anymore, you design your game while playing it.

The normal workflow of game maker tools is to start up the editor, edit tilemaps, behaviours, etc, and then generate the game. Once the game is generated, you can test it. If you want to change something, you exit the game and go back to the editor. This kind of workflow can be cumbersome and time consuming.

There are several advantages using our approach:

- You see the impact of your changes immediately in the game
- It’s more fun to work inside your game than inside a boring editor
- No need to search for the resource to adapt, you can just click on it and start editing
- Continue playing where you left off
- No need to compile/build your game before you play it


# Vision statement


:::info[Our Vision]

RPG Playground is **fun and easy** to make the **game of your dreams**, and **share it** with the world.

:::

RPG Playground needs to be both **super user friendly**, *and* **powerful**. This is not an easy combination, because the more things you can to with a product, the harder it becomes to understand and use it.

But there is a way that RPG Playground is able to combine the two, and this is by using multiple abstraction layers. If you are a new user, you start working in the top layer, and don't need to know anything about those lower layers. And when you gain more experience, you can work your way through the lower layers, and are able to customize everything inside your game.

> My wish is that one of our users will create the next game hit, and do this without any prior knowledge or experience on how to develop games.

## How?

1.  Start with a game genre, where everything is already provided.
2.  No programming. If you can read, you can add and change functionality.
3.  You edit the game while playing it, making it extra fun.
4.  Our community is supportive and helps you bring your vision to life.

Our first product will focus on creating 2D RPG games, and is called RPG Playground. But ultimately the goal is that you can create any game you want.
