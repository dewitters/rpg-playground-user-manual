## What is RPG Playground?

RPG Playground is the *easiest* tool to make your own games. **No coding** and **no download** required. It runs in your web browser and you can **register for free** at [rpgplayground.com](https://rpgplayground.com).

Imagination is all you need! Programming, graphics and music are provided by us.

Next to making your own games, you can also **share** them, and [**play games** made by others](https://rpgplayground.com/play/).

RPG Playground is constantly under development, so new features are added all the time. Take a look at [our roadmap](https://trello.com/c/OqfFeR7L) to see what is being worked on. You can [vote on your favorite features](https://trello.com/c/OqfFeR7L) to move them up in priority.

## Features

### Build your game while playing it

In RPG Playground, you make your game while you play it. There is **no separation between editor and game**.

1. Play your game
2. Open the project panel
3. Make changes
4. Continue playing

:::danger[Most other game maker tools]

Other game maker tools require you to:

1. Edit your game in a separate editor
2. Generate the game (can take some time)
3. Restart your game for playtesting

This kind of workflow is **cumbersome** and **time consuming**.

:::note

I was inspired by [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) when I created the **build while playing** feature. In Minecraft, you can build your world while you are playing it. This is a very intuitive way of creating content, and I wanted to bring this to RPG Playground.

### No coding required

Our super simple action system allows anyone to add conversations, cut-scenes, and game logic without writing a single line of code.

The action wizard will ask you to select:

1. **Who** needs to do something (the subject)
2. **What** needs to be done (the action)
3. **Details** of the action (such as what to say or where to go)

A new action is then added to a list of actions, which reads like a book or a movie screenplay.
